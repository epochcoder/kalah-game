# kalah-game

A Java implementation of the Kalah board game

This game was built with strong OO concepts in mind, and it should be able to support 
multiple types of `Player` objects.

A few that I have in mind are `WebSocketPlayer`, `AjaxPlayer`, `RandomPlayer`, `AIPlayer`.

The game currently has a very basic front-end, it replicates state from the server via JSON
